This project shows simplest form of MVVM architecture with simple bindable variables. -> Swift 5.0

Purpose of the project is to show, how generics are used in MVVM and bindable variables are used for adding observers. By using this observers, we can directly perfom action based on change in propertie's value from that perticular view.
